### Description
Given a binary tree, return the level order traversal of its nodes' values. (ie, from left to right, level by level).

For example:
Given binary tree [3,9,20,null,null,15,7],  
```
    3
   / \
  9  20
    /  \
   15   7
```  
return its level order traversal as:  
```
[
  [3],
  [9,20],
  [15,7]
]
```

# Thinking   

按层遍历，是学习树时经典题目，典型思路：借助队列，进行广度优先搜索。可以套用BFS模板：
```java

```
